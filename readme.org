#+TITLE: Introducing =biomodels.el=
#+AUTHOR: Amogh Jalihal
* Overview
=biomodels.el= provides an interface via the BioModels API.
* Data storage
All data downloaded is stored in =biomodels-download-folder=
The default value is =~/.biomodels/=

* Quickstart
1. Call =M-x biomodels-list= to show available model files
2. If none are available, =biomodels.el= prompts for a search term

Let's search for the term 'cell cycle'. 
This retrieves the first 50 results for this search term.
* Available actions 
Hitting =a= pulls up the =biomodels-transient=, which displays the available actions.
* Available actions - File Types
- Downloading filetypes
  1. SBML
  2. PNG
  3. XPP
  4. PDF
* "View" the wiring diagrams of different models
Hit =a v= to download and view the auto-generated wiring diagrams.
* Let us download a few cell cycle models
Press =a s= to download the SBML files
* View model files available offline
Quit the view using =q=. 
Restart the interface using =M-x biomodels-list=
* Available actions - Model attributes
- Features of the ODE Model
  1. Species
  2. Reactions
* Proceed with model simulations by downloading the XPP files
Hit =a x= to download and examine the XPP file corresponding to the model.
* =biomodels.el= remembers what you've downloaded
Redoing a search highlights the available offline files.
Subsequent actions on file types or model attributes  uses the local copy of these files.
* Feedback welcome!
